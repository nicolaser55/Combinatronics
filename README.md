# Combinatronics

Here I edited an algorithm to output different combinations of numbers between two numbers.

# How the project is set up

There is one python file that contains two functions. Function n_length_combo(input_list, n) outputs all the possible combinations of input_list to length n. Function combination_check(low, high) establishes the number parameters low and high and returns the combinations of numbers that when added up fall between the low and high values. Currently, the low and high values are set as low: 70, high: 75.
